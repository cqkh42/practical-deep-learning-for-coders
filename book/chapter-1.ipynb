    "14. Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?\n",
    "    - not obvious what the rules are/ patterns it picks up.\n",
    "15. What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?\n",
    "    - The universal approximation theorem shows a neural network can theoretically solve any problem\n",
    "16. What do you need in order to train a model?\n",
    "    - data. duh.\n",
    "    - labels, maybe\n",

    "    - reinforce/ bake in existing biases\n",
    "18. Do we always have to use 224Ã—224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?\n",
    "    - 'reasons'. Good trade-off between resources and performance.\n",
    "19. What is the difference between classification and regression?\n",
    "    - yes/no vs how much?\n",
    "20. What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?\n",
    "    - validation set is how we evaluate each epoch of our model. \n",
    "    - test is how we judge our whole process. Once a model is built and trained, we check it in a 'production like' state, with unseen test data.\n",
    "21. What will fastai do if you don't provide a validation set?\n",
    "    - it randomly samples a 20% validation set\n",
    "22. Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?\n",
    "    - random may not be valid. We may need to stratify if our samples may be non-representative of the real world vs model.\n",
    "23. What is overfitting? Provide an example.\n",
    "    - Overfitting is not generalising well. Predicting I am a late 20s man with a beard called Jack instead of - it's a man.\n",
    "24. What is a metric? How does it differ from \"loss\"?\n",
    "    - loss - trains the model, metric helps us judge the model.\n",
    "25. How can pretrained models help?\n",
    "    - they are pre-trained, most of the work is done\n",
    "26. What is the \"head\" of a model?\n",
    "    - the last layer/ bit that you stick on a pre-trained model.\n",
    "27. What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers?\n",
    "    - early layers pick up corners, angles and gradients. Later layers pick up complex patterns such as eyes, wheels and faces.\n",
    "28. Are image models only useful for photos?\n",
    "    - not if you can model your problem as an image\n",
    "29. What is an \"architecture\"?\n",
    "    - the structure of a model\n",
    "30. What is segmentation?\n",
    "    - splitting an image into different classes\n",
    "31. What is y_range used for? When do we need it?\n",
    "    - when we are regressing into a range, y_range clips our predictions to make sense (avoiding negatives in a positive space)\n",
    "32. What are \"hyperparameters\"?\n",
    "    - extra features which help the model choose the best parameters\n",
    "33. What's the best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization?\n",
    "    - always test on unseen data."
